 1.     FEMA Disaster Declarations Summary

 1.1.   What is the data in the submission?

The submission is a summarized dataset describing all federally declared
disasters. This information begins with the first disaster declaration
in 1953 and features all three disaster declaration types: fire
management assistance, major disasters, and emergency declarations. The
fire management information is not complete due to the historical nature
of this information.

This information is available in limited form on fema.gov
(http://www.fema.gov/hazard/index.shtm); it has not been previously
available for download in raw data format.

 1.2.   How is it generated?

The data is derived from the National Emergency Management Information
System (NEMIS). NEMIS has been used since 1998 to document all disaster
declaration as the system of record. Historical data was entered into
NEMIS to record all available disaster declaration information prior to
1998. The dataset was extracted using FEMAâ€™s Enterprise Data Warehouse
to ensure reliable, uniform data.

 1.3.   How can the data be used?

The information can be used for a multitude of purposes: business
analysis, scientific research, socio-economic study, higher education
research, planning and as raw data to test analytical tools. Users of
the data can compare disaster data and recovery efforts with external
factors in order to gain a better understanding of how to maximize
operational planning and effectiveness. 

For example, a local government planner can extract data on frequency
and type of disaster declarations in their locality to make more
informed decisions on budgets and emergency plans.

 1.4.   What data types will be in the dataset?

The FEMA Disaster Declarations Summary dataset shall feature basic
disaster incident information such as declaration title, date, incident
type and period, applicable FEMA program(s), state and county (all
records from 1964 to present include county).
